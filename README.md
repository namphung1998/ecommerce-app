This is the web application for a clothing e-commerce platform, built with React and Firebase.
The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Build and run

Make sure you have Node and either `npm` or `yarn` installed on your machine. You can then run one of
these commands to install the dependencies
